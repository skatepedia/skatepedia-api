Converse is most widely known for their Chuck Taylor sneaker which they've been producing since the 1940s. Converse first started marketing to skateboarders in the 1980s but it wasn't until the 1990s that they first introduced a skate team and skate specific shoes. That initial skate program was eventually dissolved but decided to give it another go in the late 2000s under the name Cons.", "logo": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082447im_/http://skately.com/img/library/logos/medium/converse.png", "website": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082447/http://www.converseskateboarding.com/", "links": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082447/http://www.converseskateboarding.com/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082447/http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_(shoe_company)"], "skaters_urls": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082447/http://skately.com/library/people/kenny-anderson", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082447/http://skately.com/library/people/chany-jeanguenin", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082447/http://skately.com/library/people/nick-trapasso", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082447/http://skately.com/library/people/jerry-fowler", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082447/http://skately.com/library/people/danny-supa", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082447/http://skately.com/library/people/ethan-fowler", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082447/http://skately.com/library/people/raymond-molinar", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082447/http://skately.com/library/people/felix-arguelles", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082447/http://skately.com/library/people/anthony-pappalardo", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082447/http://skately.com/library/people/sammy-baca"], "videos_urls": [], "similar_companies_urls": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082447/http://skately.com/library/brands/adio-shoes", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082447/http://skately.com/library/brands/independent-trucks", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082447/http://skately.com/library/brands/skatelab", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082447/http://skately.com/library/brands/analog-clothing", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082447/http://skately.com/library/brands/circa-footwear"]}

The name Altamont comes from San Francisco's Altamont Speedway which is most notably known for The Rolling Stones 1969 concert in which 4 people were killed. This event was seen by many as signaling the end of the Love Generation.
